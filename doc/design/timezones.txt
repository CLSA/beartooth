Times and timezones are being handled in the following manner:

- All database times are in UTC
- All times in memory (variables, active records, etc) are in the user's current site's timezone
- With the exception of low-level database code which reads/writes from/to the database, all code
  should assume that all times are in the user's current timezone (no converting necessary)
- PHP's date() function should NEVER be used, instead use util::get_datetime_object() to get a
  PHP DateTime object which tracks time zone.

NOTE: In order for this to work the database has been designed such that all DATE, DATETIME, TIME
      and TIMESTAMP columns have the name `date`, `start_time` or `end_time`
