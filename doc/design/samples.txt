Samples are list of participants.
Participants may belong to more than one sample.
Samples can be assigned to a questionnaire.
Once a sample's questionnaire is set this makes it active.
Participants cannot be added or removed from an active sample.
Samples who contain participants who are already part of an active sample cannot be activated.
Queues assume that participants can only have one active interview at a time.
